# q-learning-with-brcahistochrone
Q-Learning (some sort of reinforcement learning) to predict brachistochrone curve under gravitational field, ie, the path between two points, which takes the lowest amount of time to get to one point from another)


# NB: This model actually doesnot work very well beacause it has to be trained so many times
